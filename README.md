# Backup-Sensor

These are the instructions to create your own distance indicator device using a Raspberry Pi, and HC-SR04 ultrasonic distance sensor, and LEDs. The device measures distance in real time and uses LEDs to display how close an object is.

Components Needed:

* Raspberry Pi
* Breadboard
* 1 x LED
* 4 x male to female jumper cables
* 2 x 330 ohm resistors
* 1 x 470 ohm resistor
* 1 x HC-SR04 ultrasonic distance sensor

This schematic shows how I wired my breadboard to the Raspberry Pi:
